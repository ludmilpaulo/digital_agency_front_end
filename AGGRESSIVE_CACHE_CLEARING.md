   - All service workers removed
   - Force fresh installation
   - No cached scripts

✅ 7. Extension Storage - CLEARED (if accessible)
   - Chrome extension local storage

```

---

## 🔄 **When Clearing Happens**

```
✅ On page load (initial visit)
✅ On page reload (F5, Ctrl+R)
✅ On hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
✅ On tab focus (returning to tab)
✅ On window focus (clicking back to window)
✅ On page visibility change (switching tabs)
✅ On beforeunload (preparing for next load)
✅ On storage events (other tabs making changes)
```

**Result: ALWAYS FRESH CONTENT!** 🔄

---

## 📋 **Implementation Details**

### **Component:**
```
File: components/CacheCleaner.tsx
Location: Integrated in app/layout.tsx
Runs: Globally on every page
Triggers: Multiple events (load, reload, focus, visibility)
```

### **HTTP Headers (next.config.mjs):**
```javascript
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0

Result: Browser won't cache pages
```

---

## 🧪 **Console Output You'll See**

### **On Every Page Load:**
```
🧹 Clearing all browser cache and storage...
✅ LocalStorage completely cleared
✅ SessionStorage completely cleared
✅ All Service Worker caches cleared
✅ All IndexedDB databases cleared
✅ Non-essential cookies cleared
📊 Storage before clear: X.XX MB
✅ Service workers unregistered
ℹ️ Extension storage not accessible (normal for web apps)
✅ Complete cache and storage cleanup finished!
🔄 Page will always load fresh content
```

### **On Tab Switch:**
```
👁️ Page became visible - clearing caches
[... clearing process repeats ...]
```

### **On Window Focus:**
```
🎯 Window focused - clearing caches
[... clearing process repeats ...]
```

### **On Before Unload:**
```
🔄 Preparing for page reload - clearing caches...
```

## 🔧 **How To Adjust Behavior**

### **If You Want To Preserve Auth:**

Edit `components/CacheCleaner.tsx`, line 14:

```typescript
// CURRENT (Clears everything):
localStorage.clear();

// ALTERNATIVE (Preserve auth):
const itemsToKeep = ["auth_token", "user_data", "remember_me"];
const allKeys = Object.keys(localStorage);
allKeys.forEach(key => {
  if (!itemsToKeep.includes(key)) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
  }
});
```

---

### **If You Want Less Aggressive Clearing:**

Edit `components/CacheCleaner.tsx`, line 110:

```typescript
// CURRENT (Clears on every load):
clearAllCachesAndStorage();

// ALTERNATIVE (Clear once per session):
const cacheCleared = sessionStorage.getItem("cache_cleared");
if (!cacheCleared) {
  clearAllCachesAndStorage();
  sessionStorage.setItem("cache_cleared", "true");
}
```

---

### **If You Want To Disable:**

Edit `app/layout.tsx`, remove or comment out:

```typescript
// Comment this line to disable:
<CacheCleaner />
```

---

## 📊 **What This Solves**

### **Common Problems Fixed:**

```
✅ Stale content showing
✅ Old API responses cached
✅ Outdated images displaying
✅ Previous user data lingering
✅ Service worker caching issues

## 🧪 **How To Test**

### **Test 1: Verify Clearing Works**

```bash
1. Open site in browser
2. Press F12 (DevTools)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Reload page (F5)
5. Look for output:
   "🧹 Clearing all browser cache and storage..."
   "✅ LocalStorage completely cleared"
   ... etc

6. Go to Application tab
7. Check:
   - Local Storage: Empty (or only auth if preserved)
   - Session Storage: Empty
   - IndexedDB: Empty
   - Service Workers: None registered
   - Cache Storage: Empty
```

### **Test 2: Verify Fresh Content**

```bash
1. Visit page, note some content
2. Update content on backend
3. Reload page (F5)
4. Verify: New content shows immediately
5. No need to hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)
```

---

### **Test 3: Verify HTTP Headers**

```bash
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Reload page
3. Click on main document request
4. Check Response Headers:
   ✓ Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache...
   ✓ Pragma: no-cache
   ✓ Expires: 0
```
