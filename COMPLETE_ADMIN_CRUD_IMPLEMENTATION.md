## 🎯 Mixpanel Consent - PERFECT!

### How It Works Now:

#### First Visit
```
User lands on site
↓
Banner appears: "We use analytics (Mixpanel)..."
↓
User clicks "Allow" or "No, thanks"
↓
Choice saved: localStorage.setItem('analytics-consent', 'accepted' or 'denied')
↓
Banner disappears immediately
```

#### Every Visit After
```
User lands on site
↓
Check localStorage.getItem('analytics-consent')
↓
Found 'accepted' or 'denied'
↓
NO BANNER SHOWS ✅
↓
If 'accepted': Mixpanel initializes silently
If 'denied': No tracking
↓
Clean user experience
```

**Result:** Banner **NEVER shows again** after first response! ✨
