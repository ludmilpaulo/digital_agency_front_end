---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Signature Placement Issue - FIXED

**Problem:** Signatures were not appearing at the exact clicked position on PDF documents.

**Solution Implemented:**

#### A. Fixed Container Positioning (`SignSection.tsx`)
- ✅ Added explicit width constraints (800px) matching PDF viewer
- ✅ Centered PDF viewer with proper margins
- ✅ Fixed overlay positioning to match PDF canvas exactly
- ✅ Added proper z-index layering

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before: Flexible container causing misalignment
<div className="relative border shadow-lg rounded p-4 bg-white overflow-visible">

// After: Fixed width container for precise positioning
<div className="relative border shadow-lg rounded p-4 bg-white overflow-visible mx-auto" 
     style={{ maxWidth: '850px' }}>
  <div className="relative" style={{ width: '800px', margin: '0 auto' }}>
```

#### B. Enhanced Draggable Element (`DraggableElement.tsx`)
- ✅ Added boundary constraints to prevent signatures from going outside PDF
- ✅ Implemented `constrainPosition` function
- ✅ Added container width/height props
- ✅ Applied constraints during drag and resize operations

**New Features:**
```typescript
// Constrain signatures within PDF boundaries
const constrainPosition = (x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number) => {
  const maxX = containerWidth - width;
  const maxY = containerHeight - height;
  return [
    Math.max(0, Math.min(x, maxX)),
    Math.max(0, Math.min(y, maxY))
  ];
};
```

#### C. Improved Coordinate Calculation
- ✅ Better handling of click coordinates relative to canvas
- ✅ Proper offset compensation
- ✅ Accurate viewport dimension tracking

**Result:** 
- ✅ Signatures now appear EXACTLY where clicked
- ✅ Signatures stay within PDF boundaries
- ✅ Dragging respects document edges
- ✅ Resizing maintains proper positioning
