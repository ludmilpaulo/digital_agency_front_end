# ✅ Service to Proposal Flow - FIXED!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Problem:** When users selected a service/plan, they were redirected to https://www.maindodigital.com/proposal with a blank form.

**Solution:** The proposal form now pre-fills automatically with the selected service and plan details!

---

## ✨ How It Works Now

### User Journey

1. **User browses services** at `/services`
2. **User clicks on a service** to see details
3. **User clicks on a plan** (e.g., "Get Started", "Choose Plan")
4. **🎉 Proposal form opens with everything pre-filled!**

---

## 📋 What Gets Pre-filled

### General Service Request
When clicking "Request a Proposal" on a service:
- ✅ Service name
- ✅ Message with service interest

### Specific Plan Request
When clicking on a plan button:
- ✅ Service name
- ✅ Plan name
- ✅ Plan price
- ✅ Complete message with all details
- ✅ Visual confirmation box showing selection
