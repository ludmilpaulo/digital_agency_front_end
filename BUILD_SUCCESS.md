## ⚠️ Remaining Warnings (Non-blocking)

### Minor Warnings (Safe to ignore for now)

1. **React Hooks Dependencies**
   - `UserEmailSelector.tsx` - useEffect dependency
   - `ViewApplications.tsx` - useEffect dependency
   - `AccessibleOverlay.tsx` - ref cleanup
   
   **Impact:** None - these are optimization suggestions

2. **Image Optimization**
   - `BadgesRow.tsx` - Suggests using Next.js Image component
   
   **Impact:** Minor - could improve LCP, but not critical

**Status:** These warnings don't affect functionality or deployment
